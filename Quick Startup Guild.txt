# 🚀 Quick Start Guide — AI for Healthcare (MRI Neurological Screening)

Follow these steps to run the project locally or on a GPU server.

---

## 🔧 1. Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SourabhGoswamii/AI-FOR-HEALTHCARE_AASTRA_PARTH_KHERA.git
cd AI-FOR-HEALTHCARE_AASTRA_PARTH_KHERA
```

---

## 🐍 2. Create Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate           # Windows
```

---

## 📦 3. Install Dependencies

Install all required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If requirements.txt not present, install manually:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn tqdm
pip install nibabel opencv-python scipy scikit-learn
pip install tensorflow nilearn dicom2nifti
pip install streamlit
```

For GPU (recommended on server):

```bash
pip install tensorflow[and-cuda]
```

---

## 🧠 4. Dataset Setup

Place processed dataset in project folder:

```
processed_dataset/
 ├── training/
 ├── validation/
 └── testing/
```

Each must contain:

```
CN / MCI / AD folders with .nii or .nii.gz MRI files
```

---

## ▶️ 5. Run the Application

To start main AI screening system:

```bash
python3 app.py
```

If using Streamlit interface:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

---

## 📊 6. Outputs Generated

After running, system will produce:

* Confusion Matrix
* ROC Curve
* Accuracy Curve
* Loss Curve
* Final Evaluation Metrics

All graphs saved as `.png` in project directory.

---

## ⚡ Optional: Enable Full GPU Power (Server)

Check GPU:

```bash
nvidia-smi
```

Run with GPU:

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python3 app.py
```
